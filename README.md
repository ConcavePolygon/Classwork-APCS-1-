UPDATE!
I've moved all of my files to classwork-ConcavePolygon. 
From now on, I'll be doing my classwork from that repository, NOT this one.

### Ignore text below
# Classwork-APCS-1-
Includes all classwork that are meant to be typed (i.e. java files). 

ANOTHER NOTE:
I didn't know I had to make a github repository until today (Saturday, 10/7/22).
From now on, I'll be updating my classwork on this repository.
